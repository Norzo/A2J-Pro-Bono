    <!--NOTE: This is a really early version of this page and it will be ultimately tweaked beyond hell and back. The current version is for showing how it is GOING to look like. Do not spend too
    much time tweaking on this early model.
    To make things easier and make it able to pass the "beta test", we're making most of the pages look the same, but tweaks are going to be made.-->
